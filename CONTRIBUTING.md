# CONTRIBUTING Sighbook
Read the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/pazDontExist/mental-space-backend/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) FILE !!!!

Welcome, unsuspecting contributor! ðŸ¤¨ Another brave soul ready to endure the pain of this PHP, Composer, MySQL, and Apache-backed backend. 
Before you voluntarily dive into the depths of developer purgatory, here's a list of contributing guidelines to help you navigate the maze:

## Getting Started (or trapped)

1. **Summon the Tools**: PHP, MySQL, Apache, Composer â€“ the usual suspects in our software melodrama.

2. **Code Retrieval**: Fork the repository. If you're unfamiliar with forking, you're in for a surprise.

## Contribute (or don't, it's your call)

- **Idea Sharing**: Have an idea? Open an issue or use the Discussion Tab. I might consider it if the stars align with the cotton ball in my belly button (or if enough users show interest).

- **Bug Reports**: Stumbled upon a bug? Report it, and if you've got the patience, fix it.

- **Code Etiquette**: Write code following some coding standards. I left few files around to set some standard.

- **Document Whispers**: Improve the documentation. Spoiler: It's likely to be ignored.

- **Testing Hurdles**: Perform testing like i know where you live and you know i'm a crazy ass assassin.

## Pull Request Formalities (more like a mild inconvenience)

1. **Branch Naming**: Choose a name â€“ but that have at least some common sense.

2. **Commit Messages**: Oh dear me...Check [this](https://github.com/pazDontExist/mental-space-backend/blob/master/.gitmessage)

3. **Test Inspection**: Run tests...please

4. **CI/CD Comedy Show**: As soon as the devil will give me my 5 minutes free, i will set it up

May your contributions be as irritating as a never-ending group email chain! ðŸ“§ðŸ˜’
