**It's please should be in the TAB Discussion, but...whatever...**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Oh, the never-ending carnival of life's quirks! 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In the fantastical realm where rainbows lead to therapists' offices and self-help books grow on trees, here's the dream feature: I want a PHP-powered emotional wizard that can magically detect when my serotonin levels dip and spontaneously generate cat GIFs and motivational quotes to lift my spirits. Maybe throw in a virtual hug endpoint for good measure. Or a million dollar on my bank account.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Because who needs sanity anyway? Here are some alternatives that might tickle your funny bone:
1. Embrace denial as a coping mechanism – convince myself that stress is just a myth perpetuated by overachievers.
2. Create a PHP function to replace negative thoughts with "404 - Not Found" errors – because if it's not found, it doesn't exist, right?
3. Hire a MySQL psychic to predict mood swings – we all need a database whisperer in our lives.

**Additional context**
In the grand circus of my mental acrobatics, let me add some context: screenshots of my facial expressions ranging from confusion to enlightenment as I navigate the whimsical world of mental health features. Because, let's be real, laughter is the best therapy, and if we can't code happiness, we can at least code humor!
