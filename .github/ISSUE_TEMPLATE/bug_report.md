**Describe the bug**
Oh, the joys of coding! So, there's this sly bug lurking around. 
I promise to give a helpful description of it

**To Reproduce**
Want a backstage pass to witness the bug in action? Here's your VIP access:
1. Strut over to '...'
2. Execute a flamboyant click on '....'
3. Groove through a rhythmic scroll down to '....'
4. Brace yourself for the dissonance of an error disrupting the harmony.

**Expected behavior**
Here's what I expected: smooth melodies, synchronized database dances, and a Composer autoloader that doesn't miss a beat. No error, just a flawless performance as if PHP itself composed our project.

**Screenshots**
I know, sometimes is easier to take a photo of an UFO

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: ?
 - Apache Version: ?
 - PHP Version: ?
 - Composer Version: ?
 - MySQL Version: ?

**Additional context/Logs**
Do i really have to describe this ?
