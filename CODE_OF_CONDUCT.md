# Code of Conduct
I'm honest. I do not give a crap about who you are or what you do. Be free ! But here ? I do not have many rules (somehow i don't have them at all..just..COMMON EFFING SENSE). So:
- Respect whoever partecipate at this project (you may want to do this also IRL in any occasion)
- Be pro-active and don't deminish/demolish eventual stupid question(s). We all made stupid questions sometime at some point.
- Do not judge "how the code made by other is", instead...give some constructive criticism in order to let that person grow.

Thas's all folks.
